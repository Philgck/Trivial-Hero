Draft Readme

Introduction:

Trivial Hero is our first group hackathon project undertaken as part of the Code Institute 
Full Stack Development for the AI Augmented Developer. It aims to demonstrate our use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript, alongside agile development and use of AI tools where necessary to help with building and realising tasks and ideas.

TABLE OF CONTENTS:
Tbc, obviously.

Outline:

Trivial hero is a lightweight hero battler built using javascript and the mobile first principle, to make learning more fun. Fundamentally it is an adaptation of a trivia game, with the hero battling element integrated with an API to fetch trivia questions. Getting answers right means you fight and progress, getting them wrong means you lose. The project was designed to evoke old school retro gaming aesthetics, and on desktop (or larger screens more generally) is designed to look like an arcade gaming cabinet.

Key objectives:
A fun trivia game that gives feedback as to how well you are doing
An entertaining and evocative aesthetic that doesn’t overwhelm the ability to read.
Responsive design across different devices

WIREFRAMES ONCE FINALISED.

MIRO BOARD- Even if just a screenshot!

Imagery + accreditation if we use Itch stuff.


Thursday: After stand up, have proper stand up with us lot. Set up the repo. Scaffolding, boilerplate stuff done for the index page. Phil writes the code for the hero battler as best he can and gets something lightweight and functional. Finalise colours and fonts. Deploy something by EOD that at least has trivia questions and has the code for a fight. Stand down after the stand down at 4, call it 430.

Friday: Stand up 930, stand down 430. Build it out, get it looking close to wire frames. Start working on should haves and could haves. Agree on whether or not people are fine with doing bits and bobs over the weekend, with zero pressure established. By end of Friday: Index page with instructions, game, reset buttons, health bars, trivia questions. Finalise and push that, then *fork* a separate development branch for the other ideas. Any work over the weekend should happen in the separate branch, keeping our functional thing safe.

Monday: Stand up 930. Review anything that was worked on over the weekend, if anything at all. Decide if we want to integrate it, but only if it works. Do not break it.
